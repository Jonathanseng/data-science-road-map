# Data Science Skills Road Map

### A prioritized list of **core skills**, **personal portfolio projects**, **reading material**, and **practice assignments** every new data scientist should have.

This repo is a companion site for the course [CORE: Data Science and Machine Learning]().

The goal here is very ambitious; to be the only site you need in your learning journey as a data scentist. Getting started in **data science** is hard. There is an overwhelming amount of resources and suggestions. The goal of this road map is to get you started (or re-directed) on your journey the right way. Everything from original content to linked resources has been vetted through experience and pratice. 

Data jobs come in three general flavors (but are often called different things in practice); Data Analyst, General Data Scientist, and Machine Learning Engineer. The skills, course, and resources are divided into these categories for ease of reference.
